The code uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build an image classification model to recognition people are correctly wearing the face mask or not.
The basic work flow would be first to create a dataset by taking a large pool of images of the people and augmenting it with masks of different colors. Then we run face recognition on those images . After the face recognition we train our model to detect mask for our data set then test it. This model will be the base of our next step to detect people wearing face masks in real time.
